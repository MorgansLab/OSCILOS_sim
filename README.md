# OSCILOS_sim
## What is OSCILOS_sim ?
For the special cases of combustors which can represented as a constant area duct (such as Rijke tubes), time domain simulations can be performed using SimulinkÂ®. OSCILOS_Sim, a Simulink library which provides the building blocks for such simulations is included here, along with a brief User Guide. OSCILOS_SIM includes provision to simulate the effect of feedback control on the combustor. OSCILOS_Sim requires Matlab 2014b or later.
